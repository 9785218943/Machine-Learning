    "Ans-The four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation: Encapsulation refers to the concept of bundling data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit called a class. It restricts direct access to some of an object's components, providing controlled access through methods. This helps in data hiding, reducing complexity, and maintaining the integrity of the object's state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance: Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a class (subclass or derived class) to inherit properties and behaviors (attributes and methods) from another class (superclass or base class). It promotes code reusability and establishes an \"is-a\" relationship between classes. Subclasses can extend or override the inherited attributes and methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables flexibility and dynamic behavior in the code. Polymorphism can be achieved through method overriding (in the case of inheritance) and method overloading (having multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists).\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction: Abstraction is the process of simplifying complex reality by modeling classes based on the essential properties and behaviors while hiding unnecessary details. It helps manage complexity by focusing on what an object does rather than how it does it. Abstract classes and interfaces are common tools used for abstraction."

    "Ans=The __init__() function, often referred to as the constructor, is a special method in Python (and many other object-oriented programming languages) that is used to initialize the attributes (data members) of an object when it is created from a class. It gets automatically called when you create a new instance of a class. The primary purpose of the __init__() method is to set up the initial state of the object by assigning values to its attributes.\n",
