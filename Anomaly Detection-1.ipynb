    "Distance-Based Methods usually depend on a Multi-dimensional Index, Which is used to retrieve the neighborhood of each object to see if it contains sufficient points. If there are insufficient points, then the object is termed an outlier.\n",
    "Distance-Based methods scale better to multi-dimensional space and can be computed more efficiently than the statistical-based method. Identifying Distance-based outliers is an important and useful data mining activity. The main disadvantage of distance-based methods is that distance-based outlier detection is based on a single value of a custom parameter. This can cause significant problems if the dataset contains both dense and sparse regions.\n",
    "Outlier detection methods can be categorized according to whether the sample of data for analysis is given with expert-provided labels that can be used to build an outlier detection model. In this case, the detection methods are supervised, semi-supervised, or unsupervised. Alternatively, outlier detection methods may be organized according to their assumptions regarding normal objects versus outliers. This categorization includes statistical methods, proximity-based methods, and clustering-based methods."
